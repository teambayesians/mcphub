# MCP Hub

MCP Hub is an open source project written in Go that serves as a centralized hub for publishing and managing resources that implement the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). It provides a standardized way to process incoming requests from popular APIs—such as GitHub, Notion, and Jira—in the MCP format, making integration and automation across services seamless.

This is very early stage concept of the project. Maybe it could be changed in the future. Well... I just set up the repo, and now I need to figure out what to do next. Please [contact me](mailto:changhoi0522@gmail.com) or just make issue, discussion if you have any idea about this project(roadmap, architecture, feature, etc).
